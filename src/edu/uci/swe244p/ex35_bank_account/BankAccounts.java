   * deadlocks. Consider the harmlesslooking code in Listing 10.2 that transfers funds from one
   * account to another. It acquires the locks on both Account objects before executing the
   * transfer, ensuring that the balances are updated atomically and without violating invariants
   * such as "an account cannot have a negative balance".

           * Deadlocks like this one can be spotted the same way as in Listing 10.1 look for nested
           * lock acquisitions. Since the order of arguments is out of our control, to fix the
           * problem we must **induce an ordering on the locks and acquire them according to the
           * induced ordering consistently throughout the application**. One way to induce an
           * ordering on objects is to use System.identityHashCode, which returns the value that
           * would be returned by Object.hashCode. Listing 10.3 shows a version of transferMoney
           * that uses System.identityHashCode to induce a lock ordering. It involves a few extra
           * lines of code, but eliminates the possibility of deadlock. In the rare case that two
           * objects have the same hash code, we must use an arbitrary means of ordering the lock
           * acquisitions, and this reintroduces the possibility of deadlock. To prevent
           * inconsistent lock ordering in this case, a third "tie breaking" lock is used. By
           * acquiring the tiebreaking lock before acquiring either Account lock, we ensure that
           * only one thread at a time performs the risky task of acquiring two locks in an
           * arbitrary order, eliminating the possibility of deadlock (so long as this mechanism is
           * used consistently). If hash collisions were common, this technique might become a
           * concurrency bottleneck (just as having a single, programwide lock would), but because
           * hash collisions with System.identityHashCode are vanishingly infrequent, this technique
           * provides that last bit of safety at little cost.
