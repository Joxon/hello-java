Using either Java or Python, write a program that keeps track of students, courses, and their schedules. The program should create a database to keep track of all of this data. It provide a user interface: this interface can be a command-line interface or a graphical user interface. The interface should

  • allow new students to enroll into the program,
  • new courses to be introduced,
  • students to enroll in courses,
  • querying to see which students are in each course,
  • querying to see which courses each student is in,
  • querying to see which courses and what times each course is for a given student on a given day of the week.

The database should persist between runs of the program. So, the program should be able to be exited, and upon running the program again, the database is loaded in the state that it was before exiting the prior run.
