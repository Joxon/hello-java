 * HeapSort
 *
 * @implNote A Binary Heap is a Complete Binary Tree where items are stored in a
 *           special order such that value in a parent node is greater(or
 *           smaller) than the values in its two children nodes. The former is
 *           called as max heap and the latter is called min heap.
 *
 *           The heap can be represented by binary tree or array.
